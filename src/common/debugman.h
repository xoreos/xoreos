/** The debug manager, managing debug channels.
 *
 *  A debug channel separates debug messages into groups, so debug output
 *  doesn't get swamped unnecessarily.
 *
 *  Each debug channel is associated with a verbosity "level" at which it
 *  is currently enabled, and each debug message is sent to a channel with
 *  a number specifying its verbosity level. The debug message is then only
 *  shown when the debug channel it belongs to is enabled at a verbosity
 *  level equal to or higher than the debug message's verbosity level.
 *
 *  The verbosity levels go from 0 (disabled) to 9 (most verbose).
 *
 *  For example:
 *
 *  There are two debug channels, C1 and C2. C1 is enabled at verbosity
 *  level 3 and C2 is enabled at verbosity level 0 (i.e. disabled).
 *  These three debug messages arrive:
 *  1) Channel C1, level 3
 *  2) Channel C1, level 4
 *  3) Channel C2, level 1
 *
 *  In this scenario, only message 1, the one at channel C1 with a level
 *  of 3 is shown. Message 2 is not shown, because with a level of 4 it
 *  exceeds the current level of C1, which is 3. Likewise, the level of
 *  message 3, 1, exceeds the current level of C2. In fact, with a
 *  current level of 0, no messages will be shown for C2 at all, ever.
