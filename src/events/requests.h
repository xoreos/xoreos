/** The request manager, handling all requests.
 *
 *  Requests are the main means of communication between the game thread and
 *  the main thread, which handles all low-level event and graphics operations.
 *
 *  The idea behind requests is that, as soon as the game thread knows exactly
 *  what it needs, it creates and dispatches a specific request. Then it does
 *  other things, until it needs what it requested for, issuing a waitReply on
 *  the request. That way, the actual fulfilling of the request can happen
 *  asynchronously, without it unnecessarily blocking further execution of the
 *  game thread.
 *
 *  @note As soon as waitReply(), forget(), dispatchAndWait() or
 *         dispatchAndForget() was called, the RequestID expires.
