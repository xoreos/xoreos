%description
xoreos is an open source implementation of BioWare's Aurora engine and its
derivatives, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
version 3 (or later). The goal is to have all games using this engines
working in a portable manner, starting from Neverwinter Nights and ending
with Dragon Age II.

Currently, the "foundation" work of managing resources, reading many basic
file formats, displaying graphics and playing sounds has been done. All
targeted games show partial ingame graphics, such as the area geometry and
objects, letting you fly around in a "spectator mode". Some games show partial
menus, and something resembling a starting point for a script system is there.

No actual "normal" gameplay is implemented yet, though.
