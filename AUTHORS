boost.m4
********
   xoreos uses Benoit Sigoure's boost.m4 autoconf macros
   (<http://github.com/tsuna/boost.m4>) to check for the needed Boost
   libraries. boost.m4 is licensed under version 3 or later of the GNU General
   Public License.

ax_check_gl.m4 / ax_check_glu.m4
********************************
   xoreos uses Braden McDaniel's autoconf macros
   (<https://code.google.com/p/autoconf-gl-macros/>) to check for OpenGL
   and GLU, licensed under version 2 or later of the GNU General Public License.

freetype2.m4
************
   xoreos uses Marcelo Magallon's autoconf macros to check for the FreeType 2
   library. freetype2.m4 is part of the FreeType project
   (<http://freetype.org/>) and distributed under the terms of the FreeType
   project license. As a special exception, it may be distributed as part of a
   program that contains a configuration script generated by Autoconf, under
   the same distribution terms as the rest of that program.

glew
****
   xoreos uses glew, The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
   (<http://glew.sourceforge.net/>), to safely check for and use OpenGL 1.2+
   features and extensions. To minimize dependencies on "uncommon" libraries,
   xoreos completely includes the glew code, one of its suggested use methods.
   glew is licensed under the Modified BSD License, the Mesa 3-D License
   (MIT License), and the Khronos License (MIT License).

lua
***
   xoreos uses lua, a lightweight scripting language (<http://www.lua.org/>), to
   handle scripts from The Witcher. To minimize dependencies on "uncommon"
   libraries, xoreos completely includes the lua 5.0.3 code. Lua is licensed
   under the terms of the MIT license.

UTF-8 CPP
*********
   xoreos uses the lightweight header-only UTF-8 CPP library
   (<http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/>) for handling UTF-8 encoded strings.
   UTF-8 CPP is licensed under a copyleft license. See utf8cpp/utf8.h for
   details.

Bink
****
   The Bink decoder used in xoreos is based (heavily) on the Bink decoder in
   FFmpeg (<http://ffmpeg.org/>), licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
   License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later. Many thanks to Kostya Shishkov
   (<http://codecs.multimedia.cx/>) for doing the hard work.

WMA
***
   The WMA decoder used in xoreos is based (heavily) on the WMA decoder in
   FFmpeg (<http://ffmpeg.org/>), licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
   License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later.

DejaVu Sans Mono Bold
*********************
   xoreos includes DejaVu Sans Mono Bold (<http://dejavu-fonts.org/>) as a
   monospaced system font. The DejaVu font family is based on the Vera Fonts
   (<http://gnome.org/fonts/>), distributed under the Bitstream Vera Fonts
   license (<http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/License>).

ScummVM code
************
   xoreos uses some ScummVM (<http://scummvm.org/>) code, most prominently the
   endian, singleton, stream and audio stream code. ScummVM is licensed under
   version 2 or later of the GNU General Public License.
