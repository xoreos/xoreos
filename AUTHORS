Logo and icon
*************
   The xoreos logo and icon are the word "xoreos" and the letter "x",
   respectively, rendered in the freeware font Rezland by Fraser Davidson
   (<http://fraserdavidson.co.uk/>). Both the xoreos logo and the xoreos icon
   are licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
   3.0 Unported License (<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>).
   Thanks to Alex Bevilacqua for the idea and initial design of the logo.

boost.m4
********
   xoreos uses Benoit Sigoure's boost.m4 autoconf macros
   (<http://github.com/tsuna/boost.m4>) to check for the needed Boost
   libraries. boost.m4 is licensed under version 3 or later of the GNU General
   Public License.

ax_check_gl.m4
**************
   xoreos uses a (modified) autoconf macro by Braden McDaniel
   (<https://code.google.com/p/autoconf-gl-macros/>) to check for OpenGL,
   licensed under version 2 or later of the GNU General Public License.

ax_check_freetype2.m4
*********************
   xoreos uses Marcelo Magallon's autoconf macros to check for the FreeType 2
   library, originally named freetype2.m4. freetype2.m4 is part of the FreeType
   project (<http://freetype.org/>) and distributed under the terms of the
   FreeType project license. As a special exception, it may be distributed as
   part of a program that contains a configuration script generated by Autoconf,
   under the same distribution terms as the rest of that program.

glew
****
   xoreos uses glew, The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
   (<http://glew.sourceforge.net/>), to safely check for and use OpenGL 1.2+
   features and extensions. To minimize dependencies on "uncommon" libraries,
   xoreos completely includes the glew code, one of its suggested use methods.
   glew is licensed under the Modified BSD License, the Mesa 3-D License
   (MIT License), and the Khronos License (MIT License).

lua
***
   xoreos uses lua, a lightweight scripting language (<http://www.lua.org/>), to
   handle scripts from The Witcher. To minimize dependencies on "uncommon"
   libraries, xoreos completely includes the lua 5.0.3 code. Lua is licensed
   under the terms of the MIT license.

UTF-8 CPP
*********
   xoreos uses the lightweight header-only UTF-8 CPP library
   (<http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/>) for handling UTF-8 encoded strings.
   UTF-8 CPP is licensed under a copyleft license. See utf8cpp/utf8.h for
   details.

Bink
****
   The Bink decoder used in xoreos is based (heavily) on the Bink decoder in
   FFmpeg (<http://ffmpeg.org/>), licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
   License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later. Many thanks to Kostya Shishkov
   (<http://codecs.multimedia.cx/>) for doing the hard work.

WMA
***
   The WMA decoder used in xoreos is based (heavily) on the WMA decoder in
   FFmpeg (<http://ffmpeg.org/>), licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
   License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later.

DejaVu Sans Mono Bold
*********************
   xoreos includes DejaVu Sans Mono Bold (<http://dejavu-fonts.org/>) as a
   monospaced system font. The DejaVu font family is based on the Vera Fonts
   (<http://gnome.org/fonts/>), distributed under the Bitstream Vera Fonts
   license (<http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/License>).

ScummVM code
************
   xoreos uses some ScummVM (<http://scummvm.org/>) code, most prominently the
   endian, singleton, stream and audio stream code. ScummVM is licensed under
   version 2 or later of the GNU General Public License.
