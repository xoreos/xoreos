xoreos README
=============

xoreos is an open source implementation of BioWare's Aurora engine and its
derivatives, licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License
version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) (or later). The goal is
to have all games using this engines working in a portable manner, starting
from Neverwinter Nights and ending with Dragon Age II.

------

Currently, the "foundation" work of managing resources, reading many basic
file formats, displaying graphics and playing sounds has been done.
Some games show a working menu or even partial ingame graphics and working
scripts, but no actual "normal" gameplay is implemented yet.

For further information about the status of specific games, please visit
[our wiki](https://wiki.xoreos.org/index.php?title=Games).

Note: We are always looking for people to join our efforts in reimplementing
those games. Right now, the most pressing matter is a rewrite of the graphics
stack. Please see [the related blog post](https://xoreos.org/blog/2013/06/07/xoreos-needs-your-help/).

Compiling xoreos
----------------

Since we are not yet distributing binaries of xoreos, you will have to compile
xoreos yourself. Please read the [compiling xoreos page on our
wiki](https://wiki.xoreos.org/index.php?title=Compiling_xoreos) for information
on how to do this on various operating systems.


Running xoreos
--------------

First, you need to fully install and/or copy the game you want to play with
xoreos onto your hard disk. How you do this depends on the game, your operating
system and where/how you have bought the game.

xoreos does not yet have a launcher GUI or anything like this. You need to
start it from the command line. Run xoreos with the command line option
"--help" (without the quotes) to get a help text about further command line
options.

The quickest way to start a game in path /path/to/game/ would be to call

    xoreos -p/path/to/game/

If you're on Windows and the path is, say, D:\Path\\To\\Game\\, call

    xoreos -pD:\Path\To\Game\


Config file
-----------

In general, xoreos can read the configuration which game to run from either
the command line, a config file or both. Additionally, when you first specify
a new game on the command line, xoreos will add a related entry in the config
file (creating it first, if necessary).

To accurately identify a specific instance of an installed game, xoreos uses the
concept of a "target". Each target has a separate section in the config file,
and each of their options apply only to that target. The special target
"xoreos" is a global section applying to all games, although the same option
in a game target overrides the global option.

For example:

```ini
[xoreos]
width=1024
height=768
fullscreen=false

[nwn]
path=/home/drmccoy/games/nwn/
fullscreen=true
volume_music=0.500000
volume_sfx=0.850000
volume_voice=0.850000
```

You can then start the game with the target "nwn" with

    xoreos nwn

and xoreos will do the rest. This will start the game in the path
/home/drmccoy/games/nwn/, running it in fullscreen at 1024x768.

As you can see with the volume options, xoreos also saves settings you made in
the game' actual GUI into the target's section of the config file.

The place where xoreos expects the config file depends on your operating system:

- On GNU/Linux, the place is $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/.xoreosrc. $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME
  defaults to $HOME/.config/
- On Mac OS X, the place is $HOME/Library/Preferences/xoreos\\ Preferences/.xoreosrc
- On Windows, the file is called xoreos.ini and is in the subdirectory xoreos
  in either $APPDATA or $USERPROFILE, depending on your Windows version
