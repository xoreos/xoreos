xoreos FAQ
==========

Why "xoreos"?
-------------

BioWare's first 3D engine (developed for Neverwinter Nights) was called
"Aurora", the Roman goddess of dawn. "Eos" is her Greek name. However,
"eos" has been used as a name for software and hardware alike by basically
everyone and their dog. Therefore, we chose "xoreos", which is a pun on
xor and a popular cookie brand, while still including "eos".


What is the reason for creating xoreos in the first place?
----------------------------------------------------------

The main goal of xoreos is to have a portable, free/libre open source software
program to play the games based on BioWare's Aurora engine and its later
incarnations.

With portable, we mean at least, but not limited to GNU/Linux and Mac OS X in
addition to Microsoft Windows. While a small fraction of the games (namely
Neverwinter Nights and Knights of the Old Republic II) has GNU/Linux ports,
other games did not. As for Mac OS X, the Neverwinter Nights Mac binary was a
PowerPC one, which won't work on today's Intel Macs anymore. And later games
use a Wine bottle, so they are not "proper" ports per se.

Neither of the original games run on Free-/Net-/OpenBSD, nor on other CPU
architectures. xoreos does.

Moreover xoreos can (in the distant future) open up these games for more
extensive modding. And while xoreos itself isn't a toolset, we would welcome
a proper cross-platform toolset based on the xoreos code; even as a kind of
subproject, if wanted.


Does xoreos run on mobile devices, like Android and iOS?
--------------------------------------------------------

Currently, it doesn't, because we don't have an OpenGL ES renderer. This is
something we want to do in the future, though.


Does xoreos run on consoles, like the Sony PlayStation or the Xbox?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

No. And due to the closed and proprietary nature of these consoles, xoreos
working on any of them in the future is highly unlikely.


What about earlier games, like Baldur's Gate?
--------------------------------------------

The Infinity engine, while also having basic file formats in common, is
isometric "2.5D", so using a complete different graphical model, which is far
too different to integrate into xoreos.
Also, there already is a reimplementation of the Infinity engine: [GemRB](http://gemrb.sourceforge.net/).


What about later games, like Dragon Age: Inquisition?
-----------------------------------------------------

Starting with Dragon Age: Inquisition, BioWare stopped using its own engine.
Dragon Age: Inquisition, for example, uses the Frostbite 3 engine.
Dragon Age II marks the end of an era that started with Neverwinter Nights.


What about the Mass Effect games?
---------------------------------

Unfortunately, the Mass Effect games didn't use BioWare's own engine.
They used the Unreal Engine instead, making support not within the
scope of xoreos.


What about The Witcher 2 and 3?
-------------------------------

While the first The Witcher game is heavily based on the Aurora engine of
Neverwinter Nights, the later parts in the series aren't. They use CD Projekt
RED's own REDengine.


Will there be a toolset like the one that shipped with Neverwinter Nights?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably not. The main focus is to get the games themselves running.
A toolset is not something I'm all too interested in.

However, if somebody is interested in developing such a toolset, we would
welcome it under the xoreos banner. There is a certain overlap of code and
infrastructure, some of that already written, that's necessary for both goals.

Feel free to contact us if you're that somebody.


How do you pronounce "xoreos"?
------------------------------

Similar to [Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org/), there are two pronunciations,
depending on where you live.

US people are more likely to pronounce it "zore + eos" and European people
are more likely to pronounce it "ksor + eos".


How do you spell "xoreos"?
--------------------------

Canonically, "xoreos" is spelled all-lowercase, starting with a lowercase x.
If you absolutely must uppercase the starting letter, "Xoreos" is okay as well.

It is *never* "XoreOS" or "xoreOS". The "os" in "xoreos" is part of "Eos",
not an abbreviation of "Operating System".

xOreOs is right out.


Why are you using cairo for for shape rendering? Why not another lightweight engine like NanoVG?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem with most lightweight engines nowadays is, that they solely rely 
on a render system like OpenGL or Vulkan to render all of the shapes at every
draw call, while cairo is the only library I found so far, which offers the
ability to "prerender" shapes and cache them on the GPU. Since most of the
shapes (well, pretty much all of them) used in both dragon age games are static,
meaning, they are created only one time and then never changed again, it makes no
sense hooking the shape rendering into the render path and render shapes with
100 or more render calls in every frame. Furthermore shape rendering libraries like
NanoVG didn't offer a way to cache generated shapes to prevent exactly this.

Another reason problem resulting from lightweight libraries using OpenGL or Vulkan
as their rendering backend is their fixation on a specific set of render systems.
Through this we would have to integrate the library into our render path and almost 
certainly become locked to the render systems the library uses, meaning, if we 
decide to add a render system, which is not supported  by the library it will become 
difficult up to impossible to add it. Furthermore if you want to use NanoVG, it
requires you to specify the render system at compile time which means, the application
could only be compiled against one specific system.

Apart from that, there are multiple other smaller reasons for excluding most other
render systems out there like messy build systems (Skia), abandoned code (Anti Grain
Geometry) or bad documentation and other things which are not necessary but make 
working with cairo way simpler, like custom user fonts.   


Have you tried using Ogre3D as your 3D engine?
----------------------------------------------

Yes, I have, and it was not a match made in heaven.
No disrespect to the Ogre devs, but they don't seem all that mindful about
portability in general and GNU/Linux in specific.

A few of the things that turned me away from Ogre pretty quickly when I
investigated its viability for xoreos:

- Ogre has no concept of a system-wide installed plugin and doesn't know where
  its plugins are installed. And yes, this includes the renderer plugins. So to
  get Ogre working at all on GNU/Linux, I have to ask pkg-config for the plugin
  directory and hardcode this at compile time. The most I can do is add a user-
  modifiable config option to the xoreos ConfigManager. Not exactly nice.

  Sure, in the Windows world, where everything ships with their own libraries,
  this might be acceptable. But on GNU/Linux, this is awkward.

- Windows with a fixed size. There is such a flag to make the main render window
  fixed-sized, but it's silently ignored on all render backends but the renderer
  for Windows. This is really weird and doesn't send a great message about
  their concerns for portability either.

- I can't change the title of the main render window after it's been created.
  There is a question about that on the official Ogre forums, and the answer is:
  Cast the ogre window handle into a WinAPI window handle and call the WinAPI
  function that changes a window title. ... Yeah.

- There is apparently a way to use SDL to handle the windows and the creation
  of an OpenGL context, and then tell Ogre to use this external OpenGL context.
  Likewise, this external OpenGL context seems to be ignored by Ogre on Mac
  OS X.

So, yes, while Ogre is obviously a great engine with many features, it seems the
lack of concern for portability makes it completely unusable for my concerns,
unfortunately.
