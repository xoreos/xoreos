This is a combination of the "src" and "include" directories of the
lua 5.0.3 source package. This file will list changes applied to it:

Changes:
========

- Silenced a compiler warning (unused value) in liolib.c
- Increased the size of lu_hash, so it won't make any problem on 64bit
  systems
- Changed the definition of IntPoint() to work warning-less on systems
  where sizeof(void *) < sizeof(lu_hash)
